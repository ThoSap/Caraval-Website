					<br>
					When she's not writing, she teaches creative writing at a private college in Northern California, where she's been known to turn assignments into games and take students on field trips that involve book signings.
					<br><br>
					Initially, when she didn't wrote books she worked as a barista, a waitress, a bartender, a customer service representative for an energy consulting company, and as a sales girl at Bath and Bodyworks to help pay her bills during college, grad school, and the breaks in between.
					<br><br>
					She also spent years working with youth. She worked as a counselor at space themed summer camp, volunteered at a school for deaf children in Mexico, and had taken multiple groups of college students overseas to spend their winter vacations serving at youth hostels in Amsterdam. But out of everything that she's done, writing young adult novels has been her favorite job.
					<br><br>
					Her debut fantasy novel, <strong class="red-text">Caraval</strong> is out since 01/31/2017.
					<br>
					<strong class="red-text">Caraval</strong> has sold in thirty foreign territories, was the New York Times bestseller for <strong>fifteen</strong> consecutive weeks, the UK's Sundays Times bestseller and also the movie rights were already picked by <em>Twentieth Century Fox</em>.
					<br><br>

					<br>

						<strong class="black-text">
							"Whatever you’ve heard about Caraval, it doesn’t compare to the reality. It’s more than just a game or a performance. It’s the closest you’ll ever find to magic in this world . . ."
						</strong>
						<br>
						(Caraval Page 9)
						<br><br>
						Scarlett has never left the tiny island <i>Conquered Isle of Trisda</i> where she and her beloved sister, Tella, live with their powerful, and cruel, father. Now Scarlett's father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval, the far-away, once-a-year performance where the audience participates in the show, are over.
						<br><br>
						But this year, Scarlett's long-dreamt of invitation of Caraval Master Legend finally arrives. With the help of a mysterious sailor named Julian, Tella whisks Scarlett away to the show.

							„Dreams that come true can be beutiful, but they can also turn into nightmares when people won't wake up.“
						</strong>
						<br>
						(Caraval Page 77)
						<br><br>
						Scarlett awakes in a raft with Julian. He says Donatella will be on the island with them. She made it look like Scarlett was kidnapped so she can still marry her Count.
						When they get on the private island <i>Isla de los Sueños</i> of Caraval Master Legend it is freezing cold, snow everywhere.
						The only thing open in town is a magical clock shop. They find clothes, food, and a note to Scarlett from Legend.
						A man opens a portal in one of the clocks, a shortcut into Caraval. Julian tells Scarlett not everyone in Caraval is what they seem and won’t take it.
						<br><br>
						Only, as soon as they arrive, Tella is kidnapped by Caraval's mastermind organizer, Legend. It turns out that this season's Caraval revolves around Tella, and whoever finds her first is the winner.
						<br><br>
						Scarlett has been told that everything that happens during Caraval is only an elaborate performance. But she nevertheless she enters in a game of love, heartbreak, and magic with the other players in the game. And whether Caraval is real or not, she must find Tella before the five nights of the game are over, a dangerous domino effect of consequences is set off, and her sister disappears forever.

							This is Scarlett Dragna, the main protagonist of the book. She has grown up with stories of Caraval, told by her nana, and has always wondered from afar and the magic of Caraval.
							In the start of the book, Scarlett is distrustful of most people, as a result of her fathers abuse to her and her sister. She thinks everything through, and often does not take chances. 
							She is the older sister of Donatella, and is fiercely protective of her.

							On the left you can see Donatella Dragna, also known as Tella.

							This is the Governor Marcello Dragna from the Conquered Isle of Trisda. He is the father of Scarlett and Donatella.
							He has a huge fortune because of his rum trade and other black market dealings, but because Trisda was one of the Conquered Isles, he lacked power and respect he disred from other regents and nobles of of the Meridian Empire.
							Because of this Dragna arranged a marriage between Scarlett and a count of a noble family, that would finally grant their own some respectability and would give him more power as well.

						<h2>My Review</h2>
						<p>
							Caraval was very pleasing to read, even if it took rather long for me because I almost never (sadly) read a book in english.
							<br>
							I must say Stephanie managed to make a very fascinating book with her unique and lively writing style, no wonders that it is a bestseller.
							<br>
							I'm already wating for the release of Legendary next year :P
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="slider-display-container reviewSlides">
						<h2>Common Sense Media</h2>
						<p>
							Don't let the magical island setting fool you -- there's nothing laid back about this absorbing tale that's part smoldering forbidden romance, part rescue mission. Yes, it's set on a fantasy island, one readers would probably love to linger on if first-time author Stephanie Garber would let them. Garber doesn't linger on the details of world building -- or even let the characters sit down for a meal (do they ever eat?). Still, the fast pace does have the advantage of keeping readers fully immersed in the mystery as much as the main character, Scarlett. What's real? Who are the performers and who are the other players? Why is Scarlett's sister the one kidnapped, the one tied to the prize? How much danger is she really in?
							<br><br>
							Caraval is a zip-through read once you hit the halfway point, with more than a few eye-opening surprises at the end.
